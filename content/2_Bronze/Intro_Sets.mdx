Both Java and C++ contain two versions of sets and maps; one using **sorting**
and the other using **hashing**. For Java and C++, we'll only introduce the
former version in this module. For Python, we'll introduce the built-in sets and
maps but keep in mind that they do _not_ store elements in sorted order.

## Sets

<FocusProblem problem="dis" />

A **set** is a collection of elements that contains no duplicates.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In _sorted_ sets, the elements are sorted in order of element. Insertions,
deletions, and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number
of elements in the set.

[`std::set`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/set/set/) implements sorted
sets in C++. Some operations on an `std::set` named `s` include:

- `s.insert(x)`, which adds the element `x` to `s` if not already present.
- `s.erase(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `s` if present.
- `s.count(x)`, which returns `1` if `s` contains `x` and `0` if it doesn't.

You can iterate through a set in sorted order using a for-each loop.

```cpp
set<int> s;
s.insert(1); // [1]
s.insert(4); // [1, 4]
s.insert(2); // [1, 2, 4]

// the insert method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
cout << s.count(1) << endl; // 1
s.erase(1); // [2, 4]
cout << s.count(5) << endl; // 0
s.erase(0); // [2, 4]
// if the element to be erased was not present, nothing happens

for (int element : s) {
	cout << element << " ";
}
cout << endl;
// You can iterate through an set in sorted order
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In _sorted_ sets, the pairs are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions,
and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of elements
in the set.

Some operations on a `TreeSet` named `set` include:

- `set.add(x)`, which adds the element `x` to `set` if not already present.
- `set.remove(x)`, which removes the element `x` from `set` if present.
- `set.contains(x)`, which checks whether `set` contains the element `x`.

You can iterate through a set in sorted order using a for-each loop.

```java
Set<Integer> set = new TreeSet<>();
set.add(1); // [1]
set.add(4); // [1, 4]
set.add(2); // [1, 2, 4]
set.add(1); // [1, 2, 4]
// the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
System.out.println(set.contains(1)); // true
set.remove(1); // [2, 4]
System.out.println(set.contains(5)); // false
set.remove(0); // [2, 4]
// if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens

for (int element : set) {
	System.out.println(element);
}
// You can iterate through an set in sorted order
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Python's built-in `set` uses hashing to support $\mathcal{O}(1)$ insertion,
deletion, and searches. Some operations on a Python `set` named `s`
include:

- `s.add(x)`: adds element `x` to `s` if not already present
- `s.remove(x)`: removes an element `x` from `set` if present
- `x in s`: checks whether `s` contains the element `x`

```py
s = set()
s.add(1) # {1}
s.add(4) # {1, 4}
s.add(2) # {1, 4, 2}
s.add(1) # {1, 4, 2}
# the add method did nothing because 1 was already in the set
print(1 in s) # True
s.remove(1) # {4, 2}
print(5 in s) # False
s.remove(0) # {4, 2}
# if the element to be removed does not exist, nothing happens
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

Additional functions that sets support are discussed in the
[Silver module](/silver/intro-sorted-sets).

### Solution - Distinct Numbers

This problem asks us to calculate the number of distinct values in a given list.

#### Method 1 - Set

This is probably the easier of the two methods, but requires knowledge of sets.
Because sets only store one copy of each value, we can insert all the numbers
into a set, and then print out the size of the set.

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	int n;
	cin >> n;

	set<int> distinctNumbers;
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int number; cin >> number;
		distinctNumbers.insert(number);
	}

	cout << distinctNumbers.size() << endl;
}
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

```java
// Source: Daniel

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class DistinctNumbers {
	public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
		Kattio io = new Kattio();
		int n = io.nextInt();
		Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			set.add(io.nextInt());
		}
		io.println(set.size());
		io.close();
	}

	CodeSnip{Kattio}
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

```py
n = int(input()) # unused
nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
distinct_nums = set(nums)
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

We can do this more efficiently by skipping the creation of the list, and use a
set comprehension directly:

```py
n = int(input()) # unused
distinct_nums = {int(x) for x in input().split()}
print(len(distinct_nums))
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

#### Method 2 - Sorting

Check out the [solution](/solutions/cses-1621) involving sorting.

## Maps

<FocusProblem problem="ex" />

A **map** is a set of entries, each consisting of a **key** and a
**value**. In a map, all keys are required to be unique, but values can be
repeated. Maps have three primary methods:

- one to add a specified key-value pairing
- one to retrieve the value for a given key
- one to remove a key-value pairing from the map

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

In _sorted_ maps, the pairs are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions,
and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of pairs in
the map.

[`std::map`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/) implements sorted maps 
in C++. Some operations on an `std::map` named `m` include:

- `m[key]`, which returns a reference to the value associated with the key
  `key`.
  - If `key` is not present in the map, then the value associated with `key` is
    constructed using the default constructor of the value type. For example, if
    the value type is `int`, then calling `m[key]` for a key not within the map
    sets the value associated with that key to `0`. As another example, if the
    value type is `std::string`, then calling `m[key]` for a key not within the
    map sets the value associated with that key to the empty string. More
    discussion regarding what happens in this case can be found
    [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10124679/what-happens-if-i-read-a-maps-value-where-the-key-does-not-exist).
  - Alternatively, `m.at(key)` behaves the same as `m[key]` if `key` is
    contained within `m` but throws an exception otherwise.
  - `m[key] = value` will assign the value `value` to the key `key`.
- `m.count(key)`, which returns the number of times the key is in the map
  (either one or zero), and therefore checks whether a key exists in the map.
- `m.erase(key)`, which removes the map entry associated with the specified key
  if the key was present in the map.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
m[1] = 5; // [(1, 5)]
m[3] = 14; // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
m[2] = 7; // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m[0] = -1; // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
m.erase(2); // [(0, -1); (1, 5); (3, 14)]
cout << m[1] << endl; // 5
cout << m.count(7) << endl; // 0
cout << m.count(1) << endl; // 1
cout << m[2] << endl; // 0
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

In _sorted_ maps, the pairs are sorted in order of key. Insertions, deletions,
and searches are all $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $N$ is the number of pairs in
the map.

In a `TreeMap`, the `put(key, value)` method assigns a value to a key and places
the key and value pair into the map. The `get(key)` method returns the value
associated with the key. The `containsKey(key)` method checks whether a key
exists in the map. Lastly, `remove(key)` removes the map entry associated with
the specified key.

```java
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<Integer, Integer>();
map.put(1, 5); // [(1, 5)]
map.put(3, 14); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
map.put(2, 7); // [(1, 5); (2, 7); (3, 14)]
map.remove(2); // [(1, 5); (3, 14)]
System.out.println(map.get(1)); // 5
System.out.println(map.containsKey(7)); // false
System.out.println(map.containsKey(1)); // true
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

Colloquially, maps are referred to as **dicts** in python. They act as hash
maps, so they have $\mathcal{O}(1)$ insertion, deletion, and searches.

```py
d = {}
d[1] = 5 # {1: 5}
d[3] = 14 # {1: 5, 3: 14}
d[2] = 7 # {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 14}
del d[2] # {1: 5, 3: 14}
print(d[1]) # 5
print(7 in d) # False
print(1 in d) # True
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

### Iterating Over Maps

<LanguageSection>

<CPPSection>

An `std::map` stores entries as [pairs](/bronze/intro-ds#pairs--tuples) in the
form `{key, value}`. To iterate over maps, you can use a `for` loop. The `auto`
keyword suffices to iterate over any type of pair (here, `auto` substitutes for
`pair<const int, int>`).

```cpp
for (const auto& x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
}
for (auto x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
}

/* both output the following:
0 -1
1 5
3 14
*/
```

The first method (iterating over const references) is generally preferred over
the second because the second will make a copy of each element that it iterates 
over. Additionally, you can pass by reference when iterating over a map, 
allowing you to modify the values (but not the keys) of the pairs stored in the
map:

```cpp
for (auto& x : m) {
	x.second = 3;
}
for (pair<int,int> x : m) {
	cout << x.first << " " << x.second << endl;
}

/*
0 3
1 3
3 3
*/
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

To iterate over maps, you can use a `for` loop over the keys.

```java
for (int k : m.keySet()) {
	System.out.println(k + " " + m.get(k));
}
```

</JavaSection>

<PySection>

To iterate over `dict`s, there are three options. Dicts will be returned in the
same order of insertion in
[Python 3.6+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39980323/are-dictionaries-ordered-in-python-3-6).
You can iterate over the keys:

```py
for key in d:
	print(key)
```

You can iterate over the values:

```py
for value in d.values():
	print(value)
```

You can iterate over the key-value pairs:

```py
for key, value in d.items():
	print(key, value)
```

</PySection>

</LanguageSection>

While you are free to change the _values_ in a map when iterating over it (as
demonstrated above), it is generally a bad idea to insert or remove elements of
a map while iterating over it.

<LanguageSection>

<PySection>

For example, the following code attempts to remove every third entry from a map,
but results in a runtime error.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}
cnt = 0
for i in d:
	cnt += 1
	if cnt%3 == 0:
		del d[i]
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 3, in <module>
    for i in d:
RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration
```

One way is to get around this is to create a new map.

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}
d_new = dict(item for i, item in enumerate(d.items()) if i % 3 != 2)

print("new dict:", d_new)
# new dict: {0: 0, 1: 1, 3: 3, 4: 4, 6: 6, 7: 7, 9: 9}
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to remove and remove them
after the iteration finishes:

```py
d = {i: i for i in range(10)}
to_remove = {key for i, key in enumerate(d) if i % 3 == 2}

for key in to_remove:
	del d[key]
print("new dict:", d)
# new dict: {0: 0, 1: 1, 3: 3, 4: 4, 6: 6, 7: 7, 9: 9}
```

</PySection>

<CPPSection>

For example, the following code attempts to remove every third entry from a map,
but results in a segmentation fault.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	m[i] = i;
int cnt = 0;
for (auto &it : m) {
	cout << "Current Key: " << it.first << endl;
	++cnt;
	if (cnt % 3 == 0)
		m.erase(it.first);
}
cout << "Entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m)
	cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;
```

The reason is due to "iterators, pointers and references referring to elements
removed by the function [being] invalidated" (as stated in the documentation for
[`erase`](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/erase/)), though iterators
are beyond the scope of this module.

One way to get around this is to just create a new map instead of removing from
the old one.

```cpp
map<int, int> m, M;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	m[i] = i;
int cnt = 0;
for (const auto &it : m) {
	++cnt;
	if (cnt % 3 != 0)
		M[it.first] = it.second;
}
swap(m, M);
cout << "Entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m)
	cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;

/*
Entries:
0 0
1 1
3 3
4 4
6 6
7 7
9 9
*/
```

Another is to maintain a list of all the keys you want to erase and erase them
after the iteration finishes.

```cpp
map<int, int> m;
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	m[i] = i;
vector<int> to_erase;
int cnt = 0;
for (const auto &it : m) {
	++cnt;
	if (cnt % 3 == 0)
		to_erase.push_back(it.first);
}
for (int key : to_erase)
	m.erase(key);
cout << "Remaining entries:" << endl;
for (const auto &it : m)
	cout << it.first << " " << it.second << endl;
```

</CPPSection>

<JavaSection>

Modifying a Collection (`Set`, `Map`, etc.) in the middle of a for-each loop
will cause a
[ConcurrentModificationException](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html).
See the following snippet for an example:

```java
Set<Integer> s = new TreeSet<>();
// s starts as {0, 1, 2}
s.add(0); s.add(1); s.add(2);
for (Integer a : s) {
	s.remove(a); // ConcurrentModificationException thrown!!
}
```

One work-around is to use `Iterator` and the `.remove()` method to remove
elements while looping over them, like in the next code snippet:

```java
Set<Integer> s = new TreeSet<>();
// s starts as {0, 1, 2}
s.add(0); s.add(1); s.add(2);

Iterator<Integer> iter = s.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()) {
	int key = iter.next();
	if (key == 0 || key == 2) {
		iter.remove();
	}
}

// s ends as {1}
System.out.println("Entries:");
for (Integer a : s) {
	System.out.println(a);
}

/*
Entries:
1
*/
```

However, `Iterator` is outside the scope of this module.

The easiest option (in most cases) if you want to remove/insert mutiple elements
at once is to use your Container's `.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` methods. That
means that you should put all the elements you want to remove (or add) in a new
Collection, and then use that new Collection as the parameter of the
`.addAll(c)` or `.removeAll(c)` method that you call on your original
Collection. See the following code snippet for an example (it works equivalently
to the code above):

```java
Set<Integer> s = new TreeSet<>();
// s starts as {0, 1, 2}
s.add(0); s.add(1); s.add(2);

Set<Integer> toRemove = new TreeSet<>();
for (Integer a : s) {
	if (a == 0 || a == 2) {
		toRemove.add(a);
	}
}

s.removeAll(toRemove);

// s ends as {1}
System.out.println("Entries:");
for (Integer a : s) {
	System.out.println(a);
}

/*
Entries:
1
*/
```

## Problems

Some of these problems can be solved by sorting alone, though sets or maps could
make their implementation easier.
